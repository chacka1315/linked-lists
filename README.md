# Linked List Implementation
A Linked List data structure implemented in JavaScript, developed as part of the JavaScript curriculum of The Odin Project focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms.
This project introduces fundamental data structures, with an emphasis on node-based organization.

## 🚀 Overview
The Linked List project implements a singly linked list from scratch, allowing:
- Adding nodes at the beginning, end, or specific position
- Removing nodes from the list
- Traversing the list to display elements
- Searching for a value in the list
**This project helps understand memory-efficient data organization and provides a foundation for more advanced algorithms.**

## ✨ Features
- Create a Linked List with nodes containing values
- Insert nodes at head, tail, or specific index
- Remove nodes by value or position
- Traverse the list and print elements
- Compute length of the list dynamically
- Handle edge cases gracefully (empty list, invalid index)

## 🧱 Built With
1. Tools
- JavaScript (ES6+) — core language for implementing data structures
- Node.js — for running test scripts
- Console — for demonstrating list operations

2. Key Concepts
- Nodes and pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation simulation
- Singly linked list operations (insert, delete, traverse)
- Time complexity analysis (O(1), O(n))
- Space complexity considerations

## 🛠️ Getting Started
**Installation**
Clone the repository and run with NodeJs:

```
git clone https://github.com/chacka1315/linked-lists.git
cd linked-lists
node linkedList.js
```
Observe console outputs for demonstration of list operations.
